How to upgrade the server: 
After making changes on the server such as extension, you can only run the update script using a webupdater since we do not have access to the root server. 
1. Always back up before performing database maintenance.
2. Navigate your web browser to /mw-config/index.php. Since our Wiki is at http://itgurusgermany.com/w/index.php, then navigate to http://itgurusgermany.com/w/mw-config/index.php.
3. Select your language and click continue.
4. The existing installation should be detected. Follow the instructions on the screen to upgrade it.
5. Then use the "upgrade key", in the LocalSettings.php file to assign $wgUpgradeKey.
